# 2D Robot and Lidar Simulation

*This is a simple simulation for a 2d robot and lidar.*

A simple 2D robot version with Lidar and deterministic sensor measurements for fast simulation. Environment simulation filled with circular obstacles.
Pending implementation for compatibility with ROS and **env**. Simulation for DRL algorithms.
